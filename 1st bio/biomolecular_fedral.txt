INTRODUCTION
This chapter provides a detailed study of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, as well as the importance of water and the role of conjugated molecules in living organisms.

2.1 BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES IN PROTOPLASM

Biological molecules are different chemical compounds found in living beings. Biochemistry is the branch of biology that deals with such molecules. It also deals with the chemical reactions (metabolism) of living beings.

Approximately 25 elements are found naturally on earth, and 16 of these elements are found in the human body. Biomolecules can be classified into two major groups: inorganic (water and minerals) and organic (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids).

The proportions of these biomolecules vary in different organisms. Carbohydrates are present in the cytoplasm of cells and provide energy for metabolic activities. Proteins are present in membranes, ribosomes and many cellular structures.

2.1.1 Macromolecules and Micromolecules

Biological molecules can be classified based on size:
- Micromolecules: Simple molecules with low molecular weight
- Macromolecules: Complex molecules with high molecular weight, formed by many repeating units (monomers) and are known as polymers

2.1.2 Condensation and Hydrolysis

Condensation Synthesis
Condensation is the process by which monomers are joined together to form polymers. During condensation, water is removed (dehydration) and bonds are formed (synthesis). Condensation does not take place unless a proper enzyme is present and the monomer is in an activated energy-rich form.

Hydrolysis
Hydrolysis is essentially the reverse of condensation, involving the breakdown of a polymer into monomers by the addition of water. During hydrolysis, an (-OH) group from water is attached to one monomer and (-H) is attached to the other monomer. All digestion reactions are examples of hydrolysis, which are controlled by enzymes such as carbohydrases, proteases, lipases, and nucleases.

2.2 WATER

Water is one of the main constituents on earth. More than two-thirds of the earth is covered by water. Approximately 70 percent of any organism is composed of water. Water is the most abundant component in any organism, with the lowest percentage being 20% in seeds and bones and the highest being 85-90% in brain cells. Jellyfish has exceptionally large amount of water (99%, hence the body shows transparency).

2.2.1 Properties of Water

The properties of water that make it the cradle of life are:

1. High Polarity
The bonds formed by the mutual sharing of electrons between two atoms are called covalent bonds. Normally the sharing of electrons between two atoms is fairly equal, so the covalent bond is nonpolar. In the case of water, however, the sharing of electrons between oxygen and hydrogen is not completely equal, so the covalent bond is polar.

A polar covalent bond is a chemical bond in which electrons are pulled closer to the more electronegative atom, making it partially negative and the hydrogen atoms partially positive. Thus, in H2O, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and each hydrogen atom has a slight positive charge, even though H2O as a whole is neutral. Because of polar covalent bonds, water is a polar molecule with one slightly negative pole and two slightly positive poles.

Due to polarity, many substances dissociate into positive and negative ions and are attracted to water molecules and ions. This is the reason why most biochemical reactions occur in aqueous medium.

2. Hydrogen Bonding
The polarity of water molecules makes them interact with each other. The charged regions on each molecule are attracted to oppositely charged regions on neighboring molecules, forming weak bonds. Since the positively charged region in this special type of bond is always a hydrogen atom, the bond is called a hydrogen bond. This bond is often represented by a dotted line because a hydrogen bond is easily broken.

Because of hydrogen bonding, water is a liquid at temperatures suitable for life. The high cohesion and adhesion force of water is due to the presence of hydrogen bonds in water, which in turn makes water an excellent transport medium.

3. Cohesion and Adhesion
Cohesion is the attraction among water molecules which enables water molecules to stick together. Water flows freely due to cohesion. Water molecules also have strong attraction to other surfaces. This attraction is called adhesion. Both cohesion and adhesion are due to hydrogen bonds among water molecules. These properties of water enable it to function as an excellent transport medium.

4. High Specific Heat Capacity
Specific heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat required for minimum increase in temperature of a substance. The specific heat capacity of water can be represented as 1 calorie per gram per °C. A large amount of heat can increase very little temperature in water. Due to high specific heat capacity, water works as temperature stabilizer or regulator for organisms and protects living material against sudden thermal changes.

5. High Heat of Vaporization
Heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to convert a unit mass of liquid into vapor. Heat of vaporization of water is represented as 1 calorie per gram. This property makes water useful in cooling mechanisms like sweating.

6. Hydrophobic Exclusion
Water molecules exclude hydrophobic substances from water. For example, if you put a few drops of oil on the surface of water, the oil drops will tend to join into a single large drop. Biologically, hydrophobic exclusion is important in maintaining the integrity of lipid bilayer membranes.

7. Ionization of Water
Ionization is the dissociation of a molecule into ions. When a water molecule ionizes, it releases an equal number of positive hydrogen ions (H+) and negative hydroxyl ions (OH-). This reaction is reversible but the balance is maintained at 25°C. The H+ and OH- ions affect and take part in many of the chemical reactions that occur in cells, helping to maintain or change the pH of the medium.

8. Lower Density of Ice
Ice floats on water. This is because ice is less dense than water. The reason is that ice has a giant structure with maximum number of hydrogen bonds among water molecules, hence water molecules are arranged like a lattice. In freezing conditions, ice forms on the surface of ponds and lakes, forming an insulating layer above the water below. This provides a suitable habitat for some organisms until the ice melts.

2.3 CARBOHYDRATES

Carbohydrates are commonly known as sugars because the more familiar examples have a sweet taste. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The term carbohydrate means "carbon with water" since they contain hydrogen and oxygen in the same ratio as in water (2:1).

Carbohydrates contain a carbonyl group (C=O) and multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH). They can exist as either polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones. The general formula for carbohydrates is CnH2nOn, where n is the number of carbon atoms.

2.3.1 Classification of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are classified into three main groups:

Monosaccharides
- Simple sugars that cannot be hydrolyzed into simpler forms
- Examples: glucose, fructose, ribose
- Sweet in taste and soluble in water

Oligosaccharides  
- Composed of 2-10 saccharide units
- Less sweet in taste and less soluble in water
- Examples: maltose, lactose, sucrose

Polysaccharides
- Composed of more than 10 saccharide units
- Complex structure, generally insoluble in water
- Tasteless
- Examples: starch, cellulose, chitin

2.3.2 Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides are usually found in open chain structure in crystalline form, but when dissolved in water, most of them (pentoses and hexoses) are converted into ring chain structure.

Common examples include:
- Glucose (C6H12O6): Primary source of energy for cells
- Fructose (C6H12O6): Found in fruits and honey
- Ribose (C5H10O5): Component of RNA
- Deoxyribose (C5H10O4): Component of DNA

Ring Structure Formation
When dissolved in water, the oxygen atom from the aldehyde group reacts with the second last carbon. This forms a ring structure that can exist in either α (alpha) or β (beta) form depending on the position of -H and -OH groups.

2.3.3 Disaccharides

Disaccharides are formed by the condensation of two monosaccharides. Common disaccharides include:

Sucrose (Cane Sugar)
- Formed by condensation of α-glucose and β-fructose
- Widely used as sweetener
- Also called transport disaccharide in plants
- α-1,2-glycosidic linkage

Maltose (Malt Sugar)  
- Formed by condensation of two α-glucose molecules
- Intermediate product in starch and glycogen breakdown
- Found in germinating grains
- α-1,4-glycosidic linkage

Lactose (Milk Sugar)
- Formed by condensation of β-galactose and β-glucose
- Found in mammalian milk
- β-1,4-glycosidic linkage

Reducing and Non-reducing Sugars
Reducing sugars are carbohydrates capable of being oxidized and causing reduction of other substances. All monosaccharides and some disaccharides (maltose and lactose) are reducing sugars. Sucrose and polysaccharides are non-reducing sugars.

2.3.4 Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides are formed by condensation of many monosaccharide units (more than 10). They can be classified as:

Homopolysaccharides: Composed of only one type of monosaccharide
Heteropolysaccharides: Composed of different types of monosaccharides

Important Polysaccharides:

Starch
- Storage carbohydrate in plants
- Stored in roots, stems, and seeds
- Composed of α-glucose units
- Two forms: amylose (unbranched) and amylopectin (branched)
- Gives blue color with iodine test
- α-1,4-glycosidic linkages (and α-1,6 in branches)

Cellulose
- Most abundant carbohydrate on earth
- Structural component of plant cell walls
- Composed of β-glucose units
- Unbranched structure with β-1,4-glycosidic linkages
- Cannot be digested by humans but serves as dietary fiber
- No color reaction with iodine
- Examples: cotton, paper

Chitin
- Second most abundant organic molecule on earth
- Structural component found in fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons
- Composed of N-acetyl glucosamine monomers (modified glucose)
- Unbranched structure with β-1,4-glycosidic linkages
- Sometimes called fungal cellulose

2.4 PROTEINS

Proteins are the main structural and functional components of cells. All proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Some proteins also have sulfur. Few proteins have iron, iodine, and magnesium incorporated into their structure.

2.4.1 Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in proteins. Each amino acid is built around a central carbon atom called the α-carbon. Attached to this carbon are:
- A hydrogen atom
- An amino group (-NH2)
- A carboxyl group (-COOH)  
- A variable group known as R group or side chain

The R group has different chemical properties for each of the 20 amino acids, giving them their individual characteristics.

2.4.2 Peptides and Polypeptides

Peptides and polypeptides are formed by the condensation of amino acids. During this process:
- The -OH from the carboxyl group of one amino acid combines with -H from the amino group of another amino acid
- Water is eliminated
- A peptide bond is formed between the amino acids

Products formed:
- Dipeptide: Two amino acids joined together
- Tripeptide: Three amino acids joined together  
- Polypeptide: Many amino acids joined together

The polypeptide chain has two ends:
- N-terminal end: Has free amino group
- C-terminal end: Has free carboxyl group

2.4.3 Protein Structure

Proteins have four levels of structural organization:

Primary Structure
- Linear sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain
- Held together by peptide bonds
- Determines all higher levels of structure

Secondary Structure
- Regular folding patterns in the polypeptide chain
- Stabilized by hydrogen bonds
- Common patterns: α-helix and β-pleated sheet

Tertiary Structure
- Three-dimensional folding of the entire polypeptide chain
- Stabilized by various bonds: hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions
- Determines protein function

Quaternary Structure
- Association of multiple polypeptide chains
- Forms functional protein complexes
- Example: Hemoglobin (4 polypeptide chains)

Lipids are a diverse group of organic compounds including fats, oils, waxes, and steroids. They are defined as compounds that are insoluble in water (hydrophobic) but soluble in organic solvents like alcohol and ether. Lipids are composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, with relatively few oxygen atoms.

- Aspirin works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis

2.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS

Nucleic acids were first discovered in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher from the nuclei of white blood cells. Initially called "nuclein" because they were found in the nucleus, it was later discovered that nucleic acids are present throughout the cell.

There are two types of nucleic acids:
- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
- Ribonucleic acid (RNA)

Both are unbranched polymers whose monomers are called nucleotides.

2.6.1 Structure of Nucleotides

Each nucleotide consists of three components:

1. Pentose Sugar
- Ribose (in RNA): Has -OH groups on both 2' and 3' carbons
- Deoxyribose (in DNA): Has -H on 2' carbon and -OH on 3' carbon

2. Phosphate Group
- Phosphoric acid attached to 5' carbon of sugar

3. Nitrogenous Base
Two types:

Purines (double ring structures):
- Adenine (A): Found in both DNA and RNA
- Guanine (G): Found in both DNA and RNA

Pyrimidines (single ring structures):
- Cytosine (C): Found in both DNA and RNA
- Thymine (T): Found only in DNA
- Uracil (U): Found only in RNA

2.6.2 Formation of Nucleotides

Nucleoside Formation:
Nitrogenous base + Pentose sugar = Nucleoside

Nucleotide Formation:
Nucleoside + Phosphate group = Nucleotide

Types of nucleotides based on phosphate groups:
- Nucleoside monophosphate: One phosphate group
- Nucleoside diphosphate: Two phosphate groups
- Nucleoside triphosphate: Three phosphate groups

2.6.3 Polynucleotide Formation

Polynucleotides are formed by condensation reactions between nucleotides:
- Phosphate group of one nucleotide bonds to 3' carbon of sugar in another nucleotide
- This forms phosphodiester bonds
- Results in a sugar-phosphate backbone with bases extending outward
- Chain has directionality: 5' end (free phosphate) to 3' end (free -OH)

2.6.4 Watson and Crick Model of DNA

Historical Background:
- 1951: Erwin Chargaff discovered base pairing rules
- X-ray crystallography by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins
- 1953: James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the double helix model

Chargaff's Rules:
- Amount of adenine equals amount of thymine
- Amount of guanine equals amount of cytosine
- Total purines equal total pyrimidines

Structure of DNA:
- Double helix: Two polynucleotide chains wound around each other
- Antiparallel chains: One runs 5' to 3', other runs 3' to 5'
- Width: 2 nm
- Length of each turn: 3.4 nm
- 10 base pairs per complete turn

Base Pairing:
- Adenine pairs with Thymine (2 hydrogen bonds)
- Guanine pairs with Cytosine (3 hydrogen bonds)
- Complementary base pairing ensures equal width throughout double helix

2.6.5 Concept of Gene

A gene is a region of DNA made up of nucleotides that serves as the physical and functional unit of heredity. Each gene contains information required to build specific proteins needed in an organism. Genes contain instructions for individual traits like eye and hair color.

Gene Expression Process:
1. DNA → mRNA (transcription)
2. mRNA → Protein (translation using ribosomes)
3. Protein folds to achieve functional form

2.6.6 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)

RNA is also a polymer of nucleotides with the following characteristics:
- Generally single-stranded (unlike DNA)
- Does not form regular double helix
- Some regions may show secondary structure through complementary base pairing
- Contains ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose
- Contains uracil instead of thymine

Three major classes of RNA:

- Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
- Template for protein synthesis
- Single-stranded

Transfer RNA (tRNA)  
- Transfers amino acids to growing protein chain
- Has cloverleaf secondary structure
- Contains anticodon that pairs with mRNA codon

SUMMARY

Biological molecules are essential components of living organisms:

1. Water is crucial for life due to its unique properties including polarity, hydrogen bonding, high specific heat, and ability to dissolve many substances.

2. Carbohydrates serve as energy sources and structural components. They include monosaccharides (simple sugars), disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch and cellulose.

3. Proteins are diverse molecules serving structural, enzymatic, transport, defense, and regulatory functions. They have four levels of organization: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.

4. Lipids are hydrophobic molecules including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids. They serve as energy storage, membrane components, and signaling molecules.

5. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) store and transmit genetic information. DNA has a double helix structure with complementary base pairing, while RNA is typically single-stranded and has three main types: mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

6. Conjugated molecules combine different types of biological molecules to perform specialized functions in cells and organisms.

Understanding these molecules and their interactions is fundamental to comprehending how life processes occur at the molecular level.
