BIOENERGETICS
Photosynthetic pigments (carotenoids and chlorophylls).

Chlorophylls: The primary photosynthetic pigments.

Chlorophyll a: Bluish-green; found in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and cyanobacteria.

Chlorophyll b: Yellowish-green; found in plants and green algae.

Molecular Formula: Chlorophyll a = C₅₅H₇₂O₅N₄Mg; Chlorophyll b = C₅₅H₇₀O₆N₄Mg

Structure: Has a hydrophilic porphyrin head (contains magnesium and absorbs light) and a hydrophobic phytol tail (anchors the molecule in the thylakoid membrane).

Carotenoids: Accessory pigments (yellow, orange, red, or brown) that absorb light in the blue-violet range. They transfer energy to chlorophyll-a and also protect it from photo-damage.

Types: Carotenes (e.g., beta-carotene, orange) and Xanthophylls (e.g., lutein, yellow).

Role of photosynthetic pigments in the absorption and conversion of light energy.
Pigments absorb light energy of specific wavelengths. Chlorophylls absorb mainly violet-blue and red light, reflecting green. Carotenoids absorb blue-violet light. The absorbed energy is transferred to chlorophyll-a molecules in the reaction centers of photosystems, where it is converted into chemical energy.

The absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b.
An absorption spectrum is a graph showing the absorption of light by a pigment at different wavelengths. Chlorophyll a and b show high absorption in the violet-blue (around 430-460 nm) and red (around 630-660 nm) regions of the spectrum. They absorb green light the least, which is why they appear green.

The arrangement of photosynthetic pigments in the form of photosystems.
Pigments are organized in clusters within the thylakoid membranes called photosystems. Each photosystem consists of:

Antenna Complex: Hundreds of accessory pigment molecules (chlorophyll b, carotenoids) that capture light energy and funnel it to the reaction center.

Reaction Center: A pair of specialized chlorophyll-a molecules that can use the energy to undergo charge separation (lose an electron).

Types of Photosystems:

Photosystem II (PS II): Its reaction center chlorophyll (P680) absorbs light best at 680 nm.

Photosystem I (PS I): Its reaction center chlorophyll (P700) absorbs light best at 700 nm.

Role of CO₂ as one of the raw materials of photosynthesis.
Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the source of carbon for the synthesis of all organic molecules (e.g., glucose) during the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). Plants are autotrophs that fix inorganic carbon (CO₂) into organic compounds.

Role of water in photosynthesis.
Water (H₂O) serves as a source of hydrogen atoms (and their electrons) for the reduction of CO₂ into carbohydrates. In the light-dependent reactions, water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen (O₂) as a byproduct. The experiment using oxygen-18 (¹⁸O) proved that the oxygen released comes from water, not CO₂.

Overall Reaction: 6CO₂ + 12H₂¹⁸O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6¹⁸O₂ + 6H₂O

Mechanism of Photosynthesis
The process is divided into two phases:

Light-Dependent Reactions: Occur in the thylakoid membranes. Require light. Objectives are:

Photolysis of water: 2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂

Production of ATP (photophosphorylation)

Production of NADPH (reducing power)

Light-Independent Reactions (Dark Reactions): Occur in the stroma. Do not require light directly but use the products (ATP and NADPH) from the light reactions. The primary pathway is the Calvin Cycle (C3 pathway), which fixes CO₂ into glucose.

Non-cyclic photophosphorylation and cyclic photophosphorylation.

Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation (Z-Scheme): The dominant pathway. Involves both PS II and PS I in a linear flow of electrons from water to NADP⁺.

Electrons from water replace those lost from PS II.

Electrons flow through an electron transport chain (ETC) to PS I, creating a proton gradient used to make ATP (chemiosmosis).

Electrons from PS I are used to reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH.

Products: ATP, NADPH, and O₂.

Cyclic Photophosphorylation: Involves only PS I. Electrons are excited, passed through an ETC, and then returned to PS I. This cycle only generates ATP (no NADPH or O₂ is produced). It is used to meet the cell's additional ATP demands.

Chemiosmosis and ATP Synthesis
The electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane pumps protons (H⁺) from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen, creating a proton gradient. The enzyme ATP synthase allows protons to flow back down their gradient into the stroma. This flow of protons provides the energy for ATP synthase to catalyze the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.

The Calvin Cycle (C3 Pathway)
A metabolic cycle that fixes CO₂ into sugar using ATP and NADPH. It occurs in three phases:

Carbon Fixation: CO₂ is attached to a 5-carbon sugar, RuBP (Ribulose bisphosphate), catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO. The unstable 6-carbon intermediate splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).

Reduction: ATP and NADPH from the light reactions are used to convert 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). For every 3 CO₂ molecules fixed, 6 molecules of G3P are produced, but only one is a net gain for sugar synthesis; the others are used to regenerate RuBP.

Regeneration of RuBP: The remaining 5 molecules of G3P are used, consuming more ATP, to regenerate the 3 molecules of RuBP needed to start the cycle again.

Net Reaction of the Calvin Cycle:
3CO₂ + 9ATP + 6NADPH → G3P + 9ADP + 8Pi + 6NADP⁺

Fate of G3P: The G3P produced is used to synthesize glucose, sucrose, starch, and other organic compounds.

CELLULAR RESPIRATION
Cellular respiration is a series of oxidation-reduction reactions where energy is released from organic compounds (like glucose) and used to synthesize ATP.

Kinds of Cellular Respiration:

Aerobic Respiration: Requires oxygen (O₂). Final products are CO₂ and H₂O. Yields a large amount of ATP (~36 ATP per glucose in eukaryotes).

Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation): Occurs in the absence of oxygen. Final products are either lactic acid or ethanol and CO₂. Yields a small amount of ATP (2 ATP per glucose from glycolysis).

Anaerobic Respiration:

Lactic Acid Fermentation: Occurs in some bacteria and animal muscles during strenuous exercise. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate, regenerating NAD⁺ so glycolysis can continue.

Alcoholic Fermentation: Occurs in yeast and some plants. Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde (releasing CO₂), and then acetaldehyde is reduced to ethanol, regenerating NAD⁺.

Aerobic Respiration has four main stages:

Glycolysis

Oxidation of Pyruvate

Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)

Electron Transport Chain & Chemiosmosis

1. Glycolysis

Location: Cytoplasm.

Process: A 6-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.

Energy Investment: 2 ATP are used.

Energy Payoff: 4 ATP are produced (net gain of 2 ATP) and 2 NADH are produced.

Phases:

Preparatory Phase: ATP is invested to phosphorylate glucose and fructose intermediates, which are then split into two 3-carbon molecules (G3P and DHAP, which is converted to G3P).

Oxidative (Payoff) Phase: G3P is oxidized, reducing NAD⁺ to NADH. ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation.

2. Oxidation of Pyruvate

Location: Mitochondrial matrix.

Process: Each 3-carbon pyruvate molecule is converted into a 2-carbon acetyl group, which is attached to Coenzyme A to form Acetyl-CoA.

Products per pyruvate: 1 NADH and 1 CO₂.

3. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle or TCA Cycle)

Location: Mitochondrial matrix.

Process: The 2-carbon acetyl group from Acetyl-CoA is combined with a 4-carbon oxaloacetate to form 6-carbon citrate. Through a series of redox reactions, two carbon atoms are removed as CO₂, and the molecule is regenerated back to oxaloacetate.

Products per Acetyl-CoA:

3 NADH

1 FADH₂

1 ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation)

2 CO₂

Total per glucose (x2): 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂, 2 ATP, 4 CO₂

4. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation

Location: Inner mitochondrial membrane.

Process: High-energy electrons from NADH and FADH₂ are passed through a series of protein complexes (I, II, III, IV) and mobile carriers (Ubiquinone, Cytochrome c). As electrons move down the chain, they release energy.

Chemiosmosis: This energy is used to pump protons (H⁺) from the matrix into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient. Protons flow back into the matrix through the enzyme ATP synthase. This flow powers the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi (oxidative phosphorylation).

Final Electron Acceptor: Oxygen (O₂) is the final electron acceptor. It combines with electrons and H⁺ to form water (H₂O).

ATP Yield Summary (Eukaryotic Cell):

Substrate-Level Phosphorylation:

Glycolysis: 2 ATP (net)

Krebs Cycle: 2 ATP

Total: 4 ATP

Oxidative Phosphorylation (via ETC):

Glycolysis: 2 NADH → 3-5 ATP* (see note)

Oxidation of Pyruvate: 2 NADH → 5 ATP

Krebs Cycle: 6 NADH → 15 ATP; 2 FADH₂ → 3 ATP

Total: 26-28 ATP

GRAND TOTAL: 30-32 ATP per glucose molecule
Note: Cytosolic NADH from glycolysis must be shuttled into the mitochondrion, costing some energy. The yield can be 2.5 or 1.5 ATP per NADH depending on the shuttle used.

Oxidation of Other Molecules:

Fats: Broken down into glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol enters glycolysis. Fatty acids are broken down via beta-oxidation into acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle.

Proteins: Broken down into amino acids. After deamination (removal of the amino group), the carbon skeletons are converted into intermediates of glycolysis or the Krebs cycle.

PHOTORESPIRATION
Photorespiration is a process in plants where RubisCO (the enzyme that normally fixes CO₂) binds oxygen (O₂) instead. This occurs especially on hot, dry days when stomata are closed to conserve water, leading to low CO₂ and high O₂ concentrations inside the leaf.

Mechanism:

RubisCO adds O₂ to RuBP instead of CO₂.

This produces one molecule of 3-PGA (useful) and one molecule of a 2-carbon toxic compound, phosphoglycolate.

The plant must detoxify phosphoglycolate in an energy-expensive process (in peroxisomes and mitochondria) that consumes ATP and releases CO₂, undoing the work of photosynthesis. No ATP is produced.

C4 Photosynthesis (An Adaptation)
C4 plants (e.g., maize, sugarcane) have evolved a mechanism to minimize photorespiration.

Location: Mesophyll cells and Bundle sheath cells (Kranz anatomy).

Process:

In mesophyll cells, CO₂ is fixed into a 4-carbon compound (oxaloacetate, then malate) using the enzyme PEP carboxylase, which has no affinity for O₂.

The 4-carbon compound is transported to bundle sheath cells.

Inside the bundle sheath cells, the 4-carbon compound breaks down, releasing a high concentration of CO₂ right at the site of the Calvin cycle.

This high CO₂ concentration saturates RubisCO, preventing it from binding O₂ and thus preventing photorespiration.

While the C4 pathway uses extra ATP, it is advantageous in hot, sunny conditions.

CAM Photosynthesis
CAM plants (e.g., cacti, pineapples) open their stomata at night to take in CO₂ and fix it into organic acids. During the day, when stomata are closed, they release the CO₂ from these acids for use in the Calvin cycle. This temporal separation also prevents photorespiration.
