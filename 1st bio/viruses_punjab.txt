Viruses:
Introduction: Viruses are infectious agents that lack cellular structure. They can replicate only inside the living cells of organisms. Viruses infect animals, plants, fungi, protoctists, and bacteria.
Structure of Viruses:
Viruses consist of:
- A core of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA).
- A protein coat called a capsid.
- Some viruses have an additional envelope made of lipids and proteins.
Size: Viruses are very small, ranging from 20nm to 300nm. They can only be seen under an electron microscope.
Characteristics of Viruses:
- Lack cellular organization.
- Possess either DNA or RNA as genetic material, never both.
- Cannot grow or reproduce independently.
- Multiply only inside living cells (obligate parasites).
- Do not respire or excrete.
- Can mutate.
- Show host specificity.
Examples of Viruses:
- Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV): Affects tobacco plants.
- Bacteriophage: Infects bacteria.
- Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): Causes AIDS.
- Influenza Virus: Causes flu.
- Hepatitis Virus: Causes hepatitis.
Viral Diseases in Humans:
1. Influenza (Flu):
- Caused by influenza virus.
- Symptoms: Fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue.
- Transmission: Airborne droplets, direct contact.
2. Hepatitis:
- Caused by hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E).
- Symptoms: Jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea.
- Transmission: Contaminated food, water, blood transfusion, sexual contact.
3. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):
- Caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).
- Destroys immune system by attacking helper T-cells.
- Symptoms: Weight loss, prolonged fever, diarrhea, skin rashes, frequent infections.
- Transmission: Sexual contact, sharing needles, contaminated blood transfusion, from mother to child.
4. Polio (Poliomyelitis):
- Caused by poliovirus.
- Affects nervous system, may lead to paralysis.
- Transmission: Contaminated food and water (fecal-oral route).
5. Common Cold:
- Caused by rhinoviruses.
- Symptoms: Sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, mild fever, headache.
- Transmission: Airborne droplets, direct contact.
Viral Diseases in Plants:
1. Tobacco Mosaic Disease:
- Caused by TMV.
- Symptoms: Mosaic-like discoloration on leaves, stunted growth.
2. Cotton Leaf Curl Disease:
- Caused by a virus.
- Symptoms: Curling of leaves, stunted plant growth, reduced yield.
Viral Diseases in Animals:
1. Foot and Mouth Disease:
- Affects cattle, sheep, goats.
- Symptoms: Fever, blisters in mouth and feet, excessive salivation, lameness.
2. Rabies:
- Caused by rabies virus (Rhabdovirus).
- Affects mammals, including humans.
- Symptoms: Fear of water (hydrophobia), aggression, paralysis, death if untreated.
Economic Importance of Viruses:
Harmful Aspects:
- Cause diseases in humans, animals, and plants.
- Economic loss in agriculture and livestock.
Beneficial Aspects:
- Bacteriophages are used in phage therapy.
- Viruses are used in research (genetic engineering, vaccines).
- Some viruses are used as vectors in biotechnology.
Prevention and Control of Viral Diseases:
- Vaccination (Polio, Hepatitis B, Influenza, Rabies).
- Proper sanitation and hygiene.
- Avoiding contact with infected individuals.
- Use of antiviral drugs in some cases.
