The Human Digestive System
Oral Cavity (Mouth)
The oral cavity is the entrance to the digestive system. It is surrounded by the lips and is closed by the jaws. The roof is formed by the hard and soft palate, which separates it from the nasal cavity. The tongue occupies the floor of the oral cavity. The lips close the oral cavity when shut.

Tongue: Rough projections called papillae on the surface of the tongue provide friction, which is useful in handling food. These papillae also contain taste buds.

Teeth: Different types of teeth are adapted for different functions.

Incisors: Chisel-shaped with sharp edges to bite off pieces of food.

Canines: Conical and pointed for piercing or tearing food.

Premolars & Molars: Have broad, lumpy surfaces and are used for crushing and grinding food.

Histology: The wall of the alimentary canal from the esophagus to the anus has four major layers: serosa, muscularis, submucosa, and mucosa.

Digestion in the Mouth

Mechanical Digestion (Mastication): Cooking and thorough chewing break the cellulose covering of starch and increase the surface area for the action of digestive enzymes. Food is chewed, or masticated, by the teeth, breaking large particles into smaller ones.

Chemical Digestion: Saliva is secreted by three pairs of salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, sublingual).

The watery part contains a digestive enzyme called salivary amylase (ptyalin), which breaks down starch into the disaccharides maltose and isomaltose. Only about 3-5% of total carbohydrates are digested here.

Mucin, a proteoglycan, gives a lubricating quality to saliva.

Water moistens food and the mucous membrane.

Contains mineral salts, including chloride ions which activate salivary amylase.

Contains lysozyme and immunoglobulins to prevent bacterial infection.

Saliva has a pH of ~6.00-7.00, a favorable range for its digestive enzymes.

Pharynx and Swallowing
The pharynx is a cavity behind the mouth. The tongue forms the chewed and moistened food into a ball-like mass called a bolus and pushes it into the pharynx.

The swallowing reflex is an involuntary action.

The soft palate rises to close the nasopharynx.

The larynx rises, and the epiglottis cartilage drops to cover the glottis (the opening to the larynx and trachea), directing food into the esophagus and preventing it from entering the trachea.

Esophagus
The esophagus is a ~25 cm long tube extending from the pharynx to the stomach, passing through the diaphragm.

Function: Serves as a passageway. No significant digestion occurs here.

Movement: Food is propelled by peristalsis—a wave of relaxation of circular muscles in front of the bolus, followed by a wave of strong contraction behind it. Reverse peristalsis (antiperistalsis) can lead to vomiting.

Stomach
The stomach is an enlarged, J-shaped segment in the upper left abdomen.

Openings:

Cardiac Opening: Where the esophagus enters, guarded by the cardiac sphincter.

Pyloric Opening: Where the stomach empties into the duodenum, guarded by the pyloric sphincter.

Histology: The stomach wall has the four standard layers. Its muscularis has three layers: longitudinal, circular, and an inner oblique layer. The mucosa is lined with simple columnar epithelium and contains gastric pits leading to gastric glands.

Cell Types in Gastric Glands:

Surface Mucous Cells: Produce mucus.

Parietal (Oxyntic) Cells: Secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor.

Chief (Zymogenic) Cells: Secrete pepsinogen (the inactive precursor of pepsin).

Endocrine Cells: Secrete the hormone gastrin.

Digestion in the Stomach

Mechanical Digestion: The churning action of the stomach's smooth muscles mixes food with gastric juice, forming a semi-fluid mixture called chyme.

Chemical Digestion:

HCl provides an acidic environment (pH ~2.0) optimal for pepsin and kills many microbes.

Pepsinogen is converted to active pepsin by HCl and by other pepsin molecules (autocatalysis). Pepsin breaks proteins into smaller peptides.

Regulation of Gastric Secretion: (~2-3 liters of gastric juice are produced daily).

Cephalic Phase: Triggered by the sight, smell, taste, or thought of food via the vagus nerve. Stimulates secretion of acetylcholine (ACh) and gastrin.

Gastric Phase: Triggered by the presence of food in the stomach (distention and amino acids). Continues to stimulate gastrin and ACh release.

Intestinal Phase: Inhibits gastric secretion when chyme enters the duodenum (hormones: secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, cholecystokinin).

Small Intestine
The small intestine is the primary site for digestion and absorption. It is divided into:

Duodenum: (~25 cm long) where bile and pancreatic juices are received.

Jejunum: (~2.5 m long).

Ileum: (~3.5 m long) ends at the ileocecal junction (guarded by the ileocecal valve), where it connects to the large intestine.

Digestion in the Small Intestine

Bile: Produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder. Contains bile salts which emulsify fats into small droplets, increasing the surface area for lipase action.

Pancreatic Juice: Contains enzymes and bicarbonate.

Trypsinogen is activated to trypsin by the intestinal enzyme enterokinase. Trypsin then activates other proteases.

Chymotrypsinogen → Chymotrypsin

Procarboxypeptidase → Carboxypeptidase

Pancreatic amylase continues carbohydrate digestion.

Pancreatic lipase breaks down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol.

Nucleases (ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease) break down RNA and DNA.

Bicarbonate neutralizes acidic chyme.

Intestinal Juice: Secreted by the lining of the jejunum and ileum. Contains enzymes like:

Maltase: Converts maltose to glucose.

Lactase: Converts lactose to glucose and galactose.

Sucrase: Converts sucrose to glucose and fructose.

Peptidases: Break down peptides into amino acids.

Absorption in the Small Intestine
The inner surface is highly folded into villi and microvilli (brush border), massively increasing the surface area for absorption.

Monosaccharides (glucose, galactose) are absorbed via active transport into the blood capillaries of villi and transported to the liver via the hepatic portal vein.

Amino Acids are absorbed via active transport into the blood capillaries.

Fatty Acids and Glycerol: Bile salts form micelles to transport them to the epithelial cells. Inside the cells, they are re-synthesized into triglycerides.

Triglycerides are mixed with cholesterol and coated with proteins to form chylomicrons.

Chylomicrons are too large for capillaries; they enter the lacteals (lymph capillaries) in the villi and are transported via the lymphatic system to the bloodstream.

Large Intestine (Colon)
The large intestine consists of the cecum (with the appendix), colon (ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid), rectum, and anus.

Functions:

Absorption of water and electrolytes, solidifying the waste into feces.

Absorption of vitamins (Vitamin K and Biotin) produced by symbiotic bacteria.

Protecting from infections via its mucosa and bacterial flora.

Defecation: Feces are stored in the distal colon and rectum. The defecation reflex is initiated by distention of the rectal wall. Voluntary contraction of abdominal muscles and relaxation of the anal sphincters allow expulsion.

Liver
The liver performs over 500 functions, including:

Production of Bile: Bile contains water, bile salts, bile pigments (bilirubin, biliverdin), cholesterol, and lecithin.

Metabolic Processing: Processes nutrients from the hepatic portal blood.

Storage: Stores glycogen, fats, vitamins (A, B12, D, E, K), iron, and copper.

Synthesis: Synthesizes plasma proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, prothrombin).

Detoxification: Bre down toxins and drugs.

Phagocytosis: Kupffer cells in the liver phagocytize old RBCs and pathogens.

Excretion: Converts the toxic ammonia (from protein breakdown) into less toxic urea.

Gallbladder
The gallbladder is a sac-like structure on the inferior surface of the liver that stores and concentrates bile. Bile is released into the duodenum in response to the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which is secreted when fatty chyme enters the duodenum.

Pancreas
The pancreas is both an endocrine (produces insulin, glucagon) and exocrine gland.

Exocrine Function: Produces pancreatic juice.

The aqueous, bicarbonate-rich component is stimulated by the hormone secretin (released in response to acidic chyme).

The enzyme-rich component from acinar cells is stimulated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) (released in response to fats and proteins).

DISORDERS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND FOOD HABITS
Ulcer (Peptic Ulcer)
An ulcer is a sore in the lining of the stomach or duodenum where the tissue has been eroded by digestive juices.

Cause: Primarily caused by infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Other factors include overuse of NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs like aspirin) and hereditary predisposition.

Treatment: Antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori, acid-suppressing medications. (Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won the Nobel Prize in 2005 for discovering the role of H. pylori in ulcers).

Food Poisoning
Illness from ingesting food contaminated with bacteria (e.g., Salmonella), viruses, or toxins.

Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.

Prevention: Follow basic hygiene. Avoid unboiled/unbottled water, unpeeled fruits. Consume freshly prepared hot food or thoroughly reheated food.

Dyspepsia (Indigestion)
Difficulty in digesting food.

Causes: Excessive stomach acidity, faulty functioning of the liver leading to insufficient bile secretion.

Management: Avoid food that worsens symptoms. Stop smoking, reduce weight, avoid fatty foods, heavy lifting, and bending after meals.

Obesity
A condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation.

Causes: Result of taking in more calories than are expended through metabolic activity and physical exercise.

Health Risks: Increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, joint problems, and certain cancers.

Management: Controlled diet and regular exercise.

Bulimia Nervosa
A neurotic disorder, often in slightly older girls, characterized by bouts of voracious eating (bingeing) followed by self-induced vomiting, fasting, or laxative use (purging).

Effects: Leads to electrolyte imbalances, frequent weight fluctuations, and damage to the esophagus and teeth.

Treatment: Requires prolonged psychotherapy. Initial treatment focuses on correcting malnutrition and breaking the binge-purge cycle.

Anorexia Nervosa
A psychological disorder, most common in girls aged 12-21, characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, leading to self-starvation and excessive weight loss.

Symptoms: Extreme weight loss, refusal to maintain a healthy weight, amenorrhea (cessation of periods), retreat into a childlike state.

Treatment: Requires psychiatric therapy and often intravenous feeding to correct severe malnutrition and dehydration. Recovery is often slow.
