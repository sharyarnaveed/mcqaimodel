ENZYMES

Enzymes are the most important group of proteins which are biologically active.
They tremendously increase the efficiency of biochemical reactions and are specific for
each type of reaction. Without these enzymes, the reactions would proceed at a very slow
speed, making life impossible.

Enzymes are composed of hundreds of amino acids joined together and coiled
upon themselves to form a globular structure. The catalytic activity is restricted to a small
portion of the structure known as the active site. The reactant, called the substrate, is attached
to the active site consisting of only a few amino acids, while the rest of the amino acids
maintain the globular structure of the enzyme.

Some enzymes consist solely of proteins, while others also have a non-protein part
known as a cofactor, which is essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme. The
cofactor usually acts as a “bridge” between the enzyme and its substrate. Often, it
contributes directly to the chemical reactions that bring about catalysis. Sometimes the
cofactor provides a source of chemical energy, helping to drive reactions which would
otherwise be difficult or impossible.

Some enzymes use metal ions as cofactors such as Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, etc. A detachable
cofactor is known as an activator if it is an inorganic ion.

If the non-protein part is covalently bonded, it is called a prosthetic group.
If it is loosely attached to the protein part, it is called a coenzyme. Coenzymes are closely
related to vitamins, which represent the essential raw materials from which coenzymes are made.
Only small quantities of vitamins are needed because, like enzymes, coenzymes can be
used again and again.

- An enzyme without its coenzyme or prosthetic group is called an apoenzyme.
- Adding the correct coenzyme to the apoenzyme restores activity.
- An enzyme consisting of a polypeptide chain and a cofactor is called a holoenzyme.

Many enzymes are simply dissolved in the cytoplasm, while others are tightly bound
to subcellular organelles. For example:
- Enzymes of photosynthesis are found in the chloroplasts.
- Enzymes of cellular respiration are found in the mitochondria.
- Enzymes involved in protein synthesis are an integral part of ribosomes.


CHARACTERISTICS OF ENZYMES

1. All enzymes are globular proteins.
2. They increase the rate of reaction without being used up.
3. Their presence does not affect the nature or properties of the end products.
4. Small amounts of an enzyme can accelerate chemical reactions.
5. They are highly specific in their action; a single enzyme catalyzes only one type of reaction (or a group of closely related reactions).
6. They are sensitive to changes in pH, temperature, and substrate concentration.
7. Some enzymes require a cofactor for proper functioning.
8. They lower the activation energy of reactions.

Note: Some enzymes are produced in an inactive form to prevent damage.
For example, pepsin (a powerful protein-digesting enzyme) is produced in the inactive form
pepsinogen, which is later converted into active pepsin in the digestive tract.


MECHANISM OF ENZYME ACTION (CATALYSIS)

An enzyme is a three-dimensional globular protein with a specific shape determined by
its amino acid sequence. Each enzyme recognizes and reacts only with its specific substrate,
transforming it into a product. The enzyme itself remains unchanged and can be reused.

In many cases, enzymes work in a series of reactions to complete metabolic pathways,
such as respiration and photosynthesis. In these cases, enzymes are organized in a precise
sequence, handing substrates from one to another in an “enzyme-to-enzyme chain”.

The active site of an enzyme has two regions:
- Binding site – where the substrate attaches.
- Catalytic site – where the substrate is transformed into product.


MODELS OF ENZYME ACTION

1. Lock and Key Model (Emil Fischer, 1890):
   - The active site is rigid and fits only a specific substrate, like a key fitting a lock.
   - Explains specificity but not flexibility of enzymes.

2. Induced Fit Model (Koshland, 1959):
   - The enzyme changes its shape slightly when the substrate binds.
   - This change enhances catalytic activity and explains enzyme flexibility better.


FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYME ACTIVITY

1. Enzyme Concentration:
   - At unlimited substrate concentration, the reaction rate is directly proportional to enzyme amount.
   - After a certain point, increasing enzyme concentration no longer increases the reaction rate.

2. Substrate Concentration:
   - At low concentrations, the reaction rate is proportional to the amount of substrate.
   - At high substrate concentration, the enzyme becomes saturated and the reaction rate plateaus.

3. Temperature:
   - Reaction rate increases with temperature up to an optimum temperature (≈37 °C for human enzymes).
   - Higher temperatures cause denaturation of the enzyme due to excessive vibration breaking its structure.

4. pH Value:
   - Each enzyme has an optimum pH at which it functions most effectively.
   - A slight change in pH can alter the ionization of amino acids at the active site and affect substrate binding.
   - Extreme pH changes can denature enzymes.


INHIBITION OF ENZYME ACTIVITY

An inhibitor is a chemical substance which binds to an enzyme but is not transformed into product(s),
thus blocking the active site temporarily or permanently.

Types of Inhibitors:
1. Irreversible Inhibitors:
   - Form covalent bonds or destroy enzyme structure permanently.
   - Examples: poisons like cyanide.

2. Reversible Inhibitors:
   - Form weak linkages and can be displaced by increasing substrate concentration.

   a. Competitive Inhibitors:
      - Compete with the substrate for binding to the active site due to structural similarity.
      - Prevent product formation.

   b. Non-competitive Inhibitors:
      - Bind at a site other than the active site, altering the enzyme’s structure so that catalysis cannot occur,
        even if the substrate binds.
